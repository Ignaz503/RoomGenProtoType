To get the project to build a reference to the UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll or the UnityEngine.dll needs to be added, depending on Unity version installed.

The faulty one under Dependecies/Assemblies needs to be removed.

These .dlls can be found in your unity engine install path of your machine.

Probably also gonna wanna have Node.js installed.
